# Splunk Overview

Splunk is a **log management and monitoring tool** that helps you **collect, index, search, analyze, and visualize** machine data (logs, metrics, events).

## 🔑 Key Splunk Components

- **Forwarder**  
  - Installed on client machines (Linux, Windows, servers).  
  - Collects logs and sends to the Indexer.  
  - Types:  
    - Universal Forwarder (UF): lightweight, most common.  
    - Heavy Forwarder (HF): can parse/filter before sending.

- **Indexer**  
  - Stores and processes incoming data.  
  - Breaks logs into events and creates searchable indexes.  
  - Example: Error logs saved in index `error_index`.

- **Search Head**  
  - Web user interface (default port 8000).  
  - Run search queries, create dashboards, and alerts.

- **Deployment Server** (optional)  
  - Manages multiple Forwarders.  
  - Pushes configuration updates.

- **Cluster Master / License Master** (advanced)  
  - Used for scaling and license management in large setups.

## 🏗 Splunk Architecture (Beginner-Friendly)

```
         +-------------------------+
         |     Search Head (UI)    |
         |  - Dashboards           |
         |  - Alerts               |
         |  - Reports              |
         +-----------+-------------+
                     |
                     v
+-------------------+   +-----------------------+
| Universal Forwarder|-->|       Indexer         |
| (on apps, servers) |   |  - Stores data        |
| - Collects logs    |   |  - Indexes events     |
+-------------------+   |  - Searchable storage |
                        +-----------------------+
```

## ⚡ Example Data Flow

1. Linux server generates log  
2. Forwarder collects and sends logs to Indexer  
3. Indexer stores logs in searchable format  
4. Search Head lets users search data and create visualizations

## 👉 Small Setup Note

In small setups (e.g., your EC2 test instance), **Forwarder, Indexer, and Search Head run on the same machine**. This is why Splunk Enterprise was installed on your EC2.
